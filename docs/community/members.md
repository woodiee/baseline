# Members

Anyone with a github ID can be a [Contributor](contributors.md) to the Baseline Protocol, but you can also become a **Member** of our Github Organization, which will allow you to get invitations to key meetings, be assigned to Issues, and vote for Technical Steering Committee members \(provided you make at least one contribution that is successfully merged to master within the [voting period](governance.md#steady-state-periods)\).

## What it means to be a Member <a id="what-it-means-to-be-a-member"></a>

Being a Member gives you [Write](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization) access to the Github Repo as well as the [Zenhub extension](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000037261-github-permissions-and-access-in-zenhub).

Members can manage Issues in pipelines, assign others to Issues, create Epics and Milestones and push contributions to any unprotected branch other than Master/Main.

It's a good idea to become a member if you are making regular contributions and want to be assigned Issues, be responsible for assigning Issues to others, or both. Members can be technical contributors, contributors to specifications, or people stepping up to be accountable for projects.

## How to Join the Org as a Member <a id="how-to-join-the-org-as-a-member"></a>

Joining the Baseline Protocol as a Member is easy.

**Technical contributors** should contribute at least one [**pull request**](contributors.md#submitting-a-pull-request). Then, use the \#github-membership-requests [**Slack Channel**](https://ethereum-baseline.slack.com/archives/C011XCW8T3Q) to post your github ID, name and company \(optional\) and a coordinator will ensure that you are added as a member within 24 hours or less. If you do not receive a response in that time, use one of our [chat channels](open-source-community.md#slack-discourse-telegram) to contact the [TSC Chair](community-leaders.md#your-provisional-chair) and/or any member of the [TSC](community-leaders.md#your-technical-steering-committee) to expedite.

To be a Member, you must of course sign the [**eCLA/iCLA**](contributors.md#ecla-and-icla). This is essential, because you have Write access to the repo, and OASIS governance requires that content be contributed under those agreements.

**Non-technical contributors**, and in particular those who wish to be on the SSC, do not need to submit a pull request. See [Specifications Steering Committee](specifications-steering-committee.md) for details.

## Member Guidelines <a id="member-guidelines"></a>

Trust is essential for members, because any member has the ability to make significant and direct changes to anything other than the Master branch or otherwise protected branches.

Members should:

* show commitment by stepping up to contribute to key projects
* be reliable in completing issues to which they have been assigned
* attend regular member meetings when possible
* follow the project style and testing guidelines
* show an understanding of the nature and focus of the Baseline Protocol
* be welcoming to others in the community
* follow branch, PR, and code/docs style conventions

## Code of Conduct <a id="code-of-conduct"></a>

Of course, all members must respect and adhere to the community's [code of conduct](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Removal <a id="removal"></a>

Any member may request a confidential review of another member to determine whether that member should be removed by contacting any [TSC Member](community-leaders.md#your-technical-steering-committee). TSC Members and any others engaged for such a review are expected to act with the highest professionalism, work in strict confidence, and keep the identity of the requesting member confidential.

## Beyond General Membership <a id="beyond-general-membership"></a>

Once you are a member, you can:

1. Become a [Maintainer](maintainers.md), responsible for governing the contributions that get merged to the official master branch;
2. Get elected to the [Technical Steering Committee](technical-steering-committee.md), accountable for architecture and governance of the maintainers;
3. Join the [Specifications Steering Committee](specifications-steering-committee.md), accountable for proposing, prioritizing, and promoting Baseline Protocol projects.
4. Or, just write awesome code, specifications, docs and communications.
